Hi, I am Ruben and I make frontends and stuff 👋

# About me

This website i like the most:

> Spotify – as ⭐Hypertext⭐ Frontend-Dev of course the webapp whenever possible. But [a special](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) place [do these](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/) sites [earn, too](https://www.csszengarden.com/)…

My favourite thing to do after work:

> Meeting lovely people for a beer, or putting on headphones, starting a podcast and letting the time run

My passion:

> Revolving around harmony and distorted electric guitars

If I had a superpower, it would be

> Being able to turn into a ghost because: Becoming invisible/flying/physically invulnerable... all in one!

Favourite lunch:

> Pasta con pesto

How I like my coffee the most:

> Black tea. Black. 🖤

If I could have dinner with a famous person it would be with:

> Jackie Chan 😌 I'll let that speak for itself...

That's what annoys me most in the office:

> Those damn bugs! Where do they always come from? Oh line 7...

What I look forward to most at work every day:

> The certainty that in the end something has progressed again, even if it gets tricky
